Description: Framework to monitor the consumed power in various domains
 CPU Energy Meter is a software utility and library, which allows one to
 monitor power at very fine time granularities (few tens of milliseconds).
 . 
 Power monitoring is available for the following power domains:
  per package domain (CPU socket)
  per core domain (all the cpu cores on a package)
  per uncore domain (uncore components, e.g. integrated graphics, client
   parts only)
  per memory node (memory local to a package, server parts only)
  per platform (all devices in the platform that receive power from
   integraded power delivery mechanism, e.g., processor cores, SOC, memory,
   add-on or peripheral devices)
 .
 To do this, the tool uses an architected capability in Intel(r) processors 
 which is called RAPL (Runtime Average Power Limiting).
 RAPL is available on Intel(r) codename Sandy Bridge and later processors.
